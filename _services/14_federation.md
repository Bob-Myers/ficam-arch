![Federation Services - Overview of diagram follows in text below.]({{site.baseurl}}/img/services/FederationServices.png){:align="right"}

Federation is the policies, technology, standards, and processes that allow an agency to accept digital identities, attributes, and credentials managed by other agencies.

Federation has many different applications, including:

> Accepting specific characteristics (attributes such as unique identifiers) describing an individual from another organization:
An individual can use their agency-issued credential containing an internal unique identifier to directly log in to a different agencyâ€™s online service. The online service registers the unique identifier in their system for future use.

> Accepting an Authentication transaction from another organization:
Agency A authenticates one of its users and passes identity attributes and transaction details to Agency B who can grant accesses to that identity for a given application.

## Federation Services
The Federation services in the Federal ICAM architecture include Policy Alignment, Authentication Broker, and Attribute Exchange.
