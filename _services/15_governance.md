Governance is the set of practices and systems that guides ICAM functions, activities, and outcomes.

To perform effective governance, agencies must collect data about ICAM functions from many sources, such as policies and entitlements stores, and analyze this data. Proper data analytics help agencies monitor compliance with established information security policies. 

If your agency identifies problems during data collection and analysis, you should remediate these issues as quickly as possible. Real-time monitoring and risk mitigation is crucial to ensure employees and contractors have only the appropriate access, following the principle of least privilege.

## Governance Services
